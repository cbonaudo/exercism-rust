# Rust Exercism

Although there is a setup for exercism on the official site with mentored correction, etc... we'd like to do it differently at IOmentum:

## Setup exercism

- Download this repo 

```rust
git clone https://github.com/iomentum/exercism-rust.git
```

- Compare with is the rust track to know which exercises to do, in which order : https://exercism.io/my/tracks/rust

- Read the README of the exercise

- Create a Pull Request for each exercise (only modifying one exercise in one PR), that changes the name by "XXXX - Solved"

- $$$ Profit
